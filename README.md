# 2MotorTank_realtime_object_detection
tank_movement.ino - the code for the arduino (ESP32S), runs via wifi, currently controlled by html
MainActivity.kt - the code for person-detection
the next goal is to combine those so that the commands will be sent through the detection app, recognizing and following a person - instead of the html.
